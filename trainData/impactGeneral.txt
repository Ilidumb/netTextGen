[29-Feb-20 09:35 PM] cancername#0271
What do you think is the best audio codec?

[29-Feb-20 09:37 PM] false#2113
flac bc its lossless

[29-Feb-20 09:39 PM] cancername#0271
@false I think FLAC, because it's lossless and free, and M4A, because it's widespread.

[29-Feb-20 09:41 PM] false#2113
yah

[29-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
@cancername in my opinions mp3 is the best audio codec(no I am not trolling). Mp3 can have the same sound quality and frequency. Also it can be more compact. Another argument is that mp3 is the most  widely used codec.

Another of my favourite codec is aptx hd. The music sound really great on this codec.

You can truly hear the difference between aptx hd and sbc

i still prefer flac

[29-Feb-20 09:56 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
the downside being i have 13gb of audio on my phone

[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
mp3s have their uses

[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
also as for the argument of the lossless  :
lossless audio are useless imo. they weight a lot(i.e. 20 gig for a discography of ~10 album). also as for the frequency(48khz) while yes it can be great for the sound quality. headphone that support aren't that rare and don't cost  a lot (500 buck if I remember) however when it come to having speaker at that support 48 khz cost a lot.

also if I remember correctly it's possible to have mp3 with 45khz

[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but flac is lossless and open

Qt is epic

[01-Mar-20 01:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
🤷 maybe gnome has made me a retard but i kinda like gtk too

[01-Mar-20 01:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
Qt still best

[01-Mar-20 01:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but gtk is also good

[01-Mar-20 01:43 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
i'd say cli on top

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
with a twm

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

When designing an interface, imagine that your program is all that stands between the user and hot, sweaty, tangled-bedsheets-fingertips-digging-into-the-back sex.

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
with a twm

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yes

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
with a stacking wm

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
using cli programs is pretty rart

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Arisa#5591
not really

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Arisa#5591
cli software

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Arisa#5591
is good

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Arisa#5591
and epic

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Arisa#5591
I love it

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
yeah

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
cli is cool but

[01-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
they are more common on gnu+linux

[01-Mar-20 01:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
you don't really get much benefit ergonomically if you aren't using a twm

[01-Mar-20 01:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
If anything, less

[01-Mar-20 01:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
because the majority of things in a swm needs mouse

[01-Mar-20 01:45 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
also they are easy to port: i.e. my hello world program and the self bot in C# that work in wsl

[01-Mar-20 01:46 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I wish CLI app were more common on windows

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
> you don't really get much benefit ergonomically if you aren't using a twm
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 to me I prefer cli because I am lazy to switch to use the mouse <-- why I use git bash

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
if you dont use git cli you're dumb

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but say for example

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
using cmus over clementine

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
outside of a twm

[01-Mar-20 01:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
cmus doesn't make much sense

[01-Mar-20 01:48 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I use a mix of git bash and vs code to set up the thing that i dont how

[01-Mar-20 01:48 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
to set up

[01-Mar-20 01:48 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
what is cmus

[01-Mar-20 01:48 AM] JibrilPC#4329

[01-Mar-20 04:10 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342

in the loop

[01-Mar-20 04:11 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I missed the following line
```lua

for i,v in pairs(getgc(true)) do
    local gcInfo = newFile('gcInfo.txt') -- <-- this line
    if type(v) == "function" and not debug.getinfo(v).what == 'C' and not is_synapse_function(v) then
        btWritefile(gcInfo,'---FUNCTION_NAME---' .. tostring(v))
        btWritefile(gcInfo, '---UPVALUE---')
        if not pcall(debug.getupvalues(v)) then
            for _,u in pairs(debug.getupvalues(v)) do
                btWritefile(gcInfo,u)
            end
            btWritefile(gcInfo, '---CONSTANTS---')
            for _,fi in pairs(debug.getconstants(v)) do
                btWritefile(gcInfo,fi)
            end
        end
    end
    if type(v) == "table" then
        btWritefile(gcInfo,'!!FOUND TABLE!!')
        btWritefile(gcInfo,'\n' .. repr(v))

I am just optimizing the thing, it's something simple.
```lua
-- * api required : https://gist.github.com/ViniDalvino/4cca9819dea199624c377e6a4d604ff2

local gcInfo = newFile('gcInfo.txt')
for i,v in pairs(getgc(true)) do
    if type(v) == "function" and debug.getinfo(v).what ~= 'C' and not is_synapse_function(v) then
        btWritefile(gcInfo,'---FUNCTION_NAME---' .. tostring(v))
        btWritefile(gcInfo, '---UPVALUE---')
        if not pcall(debug.getupvalues(v)) then

            for _,u in pairs(debug.getupvalues(v)) do
                if type(u) ~= 'string' then
                    btWritefile(gcInfo, '---Found a table, showing the content of the table---')
                    for _,u2 in pairs(u) do
                        btWritefile(gcInfo,'\t' .. u2)
                    end
                end
                btWritefile(gcInfo,'\t' .. u)
            end

            btWritefile(gcInfo, '---CONSTANTS---')
            for _,fi in pairs(debug.getconstants(v)) do
                if type(fi) ~=
                btWritefile(gcInfo, '---Found a table, showing the content of the table---')
                btWritefile(gcInfo,fi)
            end
        end
    end
    if type(v) == "table" then
        btWritefile(gcInfo,'\n!!FOUND TABLE?!!\n')
        btWritefile(gcInfo, repr(v))
    end
end

if syn then
    messagebox("Finished to dump the garbage collector","Sucess",0)
end
```

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

If you donate $5 or more, you will receive early access to upcoming releases through nightly builds (**now including 1.15.2 builds!**), 1 premium mod (Ignite), a cape visible to other Impact users, a gold colored name in the Impact Discord Server, and access to #Donator-help (with faster and nicer responses). Go on the [website](https://impactclient.net/#donate) to donate.

@JIMP The process has been automated recently.
You will be asked for your MC UUID and it is recommended to connect your discord.

[01-Mar-20 03:55 PM] JIMP#8892
can you stop with acronyms please..

[01-Mar-20 03:55 PM] JIMP#8892
UUID

[01-Mar-20 03:55 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Since you will get updates and installers from here more easily, and you get access to #donator-help and #better-general

[01-Mar-20 03:55 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
UUID is your universal Minecraft user id. It's to identify your account specifically beyond your username.

@JIMP When you donate 5 USD or more to #Brady4207, you will receive "impact premium", which allows you to make use of "nightly" impact builds", a cape and the "ignite" module.
Your impact premium account is tied to your MC UUID for authentication reasons.

Coding with big limitation is so interesting to do. I remember talking with a old roblox scripter on how Roblox scripting back then. Roblox used to only allow the following thing for a user input : detect a right click of a mouse button. The gui were static, was only in the right side of the screen.

Halo There - Master Chief vs. General Grievous
It all started with a pun.

I created this on Meme Monday on r/halo https://reddit.com/r/halo/comments/7ysccs/when_you_forgot_its_meme_monday_and_are_late_to/

That sparked the idea to make something of true quality. So 4 weeks of Halo 5 capturing, editing, and grabbing sound ...

imagine willingly changing your name to a number

[01-Mar-20 08:51 PM] algiuxas#5282
is it correct to say "I thrive to chat with others" as "I like/love to chat with others"?

[01-Mar-20 08:51 PM] algiuxas#5282
ik that's a dumb question

[01-Mar-20 08:51 PM] algiuxas#5282
but I just want to know if it's not weird to use "thrive" in such sentence

[01-Mar-20 08:52 PM] Thunder33345#9999
it feels weird

[01-Mar-20 08:52 PM] Thunder33345#9999
like i thrive to be helpful or friendly kinda ok
but "chat with other" feels weird

[01-Mar-20 08:53 PM] Thunder33345#9999
i think it should be followed up with 1 word that describe an attribute

[01-Mar-20 08:53 PM] Thunder33345#9999
in your case like would be better

[01-Mar-20 08:55 PM] Ilidumb#0285
shouldn't it  be "I thrive on chatting"?

[01-Mar-20 08:55 PM] florida#0001
^

[01-Mar-20 08:56 PM] florida#0001
“i thrive to chat with others” isn’t the greatest way to say it

[01-Mar-20 08:56 PM] florida#0001
it’s kinda strange sounding

[01-Mar-20 08:56 PM] algiuxas#5282
I thrive on chatting

[01-Mar-20 08:56 PM] algiuxas#5282
Is this good?

[01-Mar-20 08:56 PM] florida#0001
“i strive to chat with others” has a different meaning but comes off in the same demeanor

[01-Mar-20 08:57 PM] algiuxas#5282
So which one you would recommend?

[01-Mar-20 08:57 PM] florida#0001
the latter

[01-Mar-20 08:57 PM] algiuxas#5282
What does that mean? Sorry. I'm not so good at English

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
the last

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
like the last thing in a list

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
somewhat

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
uhm i would say

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] algiuxas#5282
Oh

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
“i strive to chat with others”

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] algiuxas#5282
Okay thanks

[01-Mar-20 08:58 PM] florida#0001
it’s like you make an effort to chat

[01-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Hadex#9908

[01-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Ilidumb#0285
there is a better version

[01-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Ilidumb#0285
"I chat with others"

[01-Mar-20 09:00 PM] algiuxas#5282
no.

[01-Mar-20 09:00 PM] algiuxas#5282
It doesn't say that "I like to chat with others"

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] florida#0001
“i adore starting conversations with the people around me”

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] algiuxas#5282
I mean I just want some word that is close to "I like"/"I love"

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] sakuya#0188
first is completely fine

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] sakuya#0188
it doesnt sound strange

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] Ilidumb#0285
enjoy chatting with

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] florida#0001
“i thrive to chat with others” doesnt make sense tho

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] florida#0001
because thrive is a verb

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] florida#0001
i thrive

[01-Mar-20 09:01 PM] florida#0001
you thrive

[01-Mar-20 09:02 PM] florida#0001
but like

[01-Mar-20 09:02 PM] florida#0001
in the context it doesn’t really work

[01-Mar-20 09:02 PM] florida#0001
like thrive is weird

[01-Mar-20 09:02 PM] florida#0001
english is weird

[01-Mar-20 09:03 PM] florida#0001
like

[01-Mar-20 09:03 PM] florida#0001
“The cattle thrive on the luscious green grass”

[01-Mar-20 09:03 PM] florida#0001
would be correct

[01-Mar-20 09:04 PM] algiuxas#5282
I'll better off to use "enjoy"

[01-Mar-20 09:04 PM] florida#0001
yeah

[01-Mar-20 09:04 PM] florida#0001
“i enjoy chatting with others”

[01-Mar-20 09:06 PM] algiuxas#5282

[02-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
let's remember that the support role that I had was just a meme so I can have free alt @『EmeraldSnorlax』

[02-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Ilidumb#0285

[02-Mar-20 05:50 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 05:51 PM] Ilidumb#0285
wtf man

[02-Mar-20 05:51 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
my phone usb is weird. it's type c but it somehow doesn't fully transfer the content via the phone to my pc and vice versa

[02-Mar-20 05:52 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
i think its probably because of my scuffed cable tbh

[02-Mar-20 05:52 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 05:52 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342

[02-Mar-20 05:53 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 05:53 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 05:53 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

the bruh moment is you using windows

[02-Mar-20 05:59 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
well there's this and the fact that dolphin is running off the igpu

[02-Mar-20 06:00 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
to be fair

[02-Mar-20 06:00 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
its a game cube emulator

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
whats the point of using an rtx titan v and drawing more power then it needs to

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
when an igpu can give it all the power it needs

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
yeah but 60 fps is  better

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
its

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
a gamecube emulator

[02-Mar-20 06:03 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I feel like a chad because I use a switch on controller for pc gaming and that I don't own a switch

[02-Mar-20 06:03 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
honestly

[02-Mar-20 06:03 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
i prefer the joycons to the pro controller

[02-Mar-20 06:03 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
you can hold joycons however you want

[02-Mar-20 06:03 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
that and the buttons are clicky instead of squishy

[02-Mar-20 06:04 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
its a shame that their current linux drivers are scuffed

[02-Mar-20 06:04 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
though apparently itll be fixed in linux56

[02-Mar-20 06:22 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
how do you do for linking both to act like a single controller?

[02-Mar-20 06:23 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
you need a special driver for that

[02-Mar-20 06:23 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
which is broken on linux

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I tough steam did all the job

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
nope

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
its scuffed on steam too

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
to me I use steam for my switch gamepad

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
to a system

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
a "pair" of joycons acts like one individual controller each

[02-Mar-20 06:25 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
others thirdparty driver won't make the vibration work

So I have NSFW anime wallpapers on my phone, but I'm afraid of my parents seeing it. I wonder if there's an app which allows auto-switching to wallpaper depending on your GPS location on Android.

@『EmeraldSnorlax』 It is almost always a bad idea to recommend arch to beginners. Windows users will usually not be amazed to sit in frot of a terminal prompt, having to install shit

manjaro is arch for people who cba to tinker. 100% reccomend if your aren't gaming or doing CAD work

you can use a compositor to do that in any distro anyway

[03-Mar-20 12:34 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
Once you get past distro hopping phase you'll eventually settle on a distro, usually Ubuntu (god forbid), pop, debian, fedora, manjaro or arch

What I like with distrowatch is that you can discover a lot of distro. i.e. the kiosk distro that they feature. or linux that run on the ps2

LXDE looks really good and at the same time consumes minimal resources

[03-Mar-20 12:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

@『EmeraldSnorlax』 what's on my bucket about linux is to use linux on a ps2/3/4/5(ps5 if it have a exploit for running linux on) for a whole month as a main pc

[03-Mar-20 12:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
PSx is arm based

[03-Mar-20 12:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
either arm or powerpc iirc

[03-Mar-20 12:45 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
hm no

[03-Mar-20 12:45 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
so good luck running anything meaningful

can you please look at the edit

[03-Mar-20 12:46 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
PS3 is powerpc based. I can run linux on it if I find a ps3 oon ebay that still have other os enabled

[03-Mar-20 12:46 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
ps2 -> what
ps3 -> legit feature

[03-Mar-20 12:46 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
as for the ps4/5 it's x86 based

[03-Mar-20 12:46 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
ps4 -> why

[03-Mar-20 12:46 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I can

Official Playstation 2 Linux Kit Installation and Demo
In this video we take a look at the official Playstation 2 Linux kit that was released by Sony in 2002.  We will install the OS and then take a look at it running.

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
^

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] SlayerFox#7073
so you could use either.

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
Sony revoked it

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] SlayerFox#7073
ah

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
got class actioned

[03-Mar-20 12:47 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
fuck sony

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] SlayerFox#7073
how tf do you get class-actioned over shipping with free-to-use software?

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
no

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] SlayerFox#7073
they didn't even make you pay to install linux on the ps3, iirc

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
they advertised being able to install other OS as a feature

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
they revoked the feature because people exploited it for piracy

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
and they got class actioned for revoking it

[03-Mar-20 12:48 AM] SlayerFox#7073
oh

[03-Mar-20 12:49 AM] SlayerFox#7073
makes more sense

ah yes

lmao

[03-Mar-20 12:49 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342

@『EmeraldSnorlax』 which was false

[03-Mar-20 12:49 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
no

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
there was an exploit in it where you could read all of memory

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
so they got decryption keys

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
and dumped games

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
why didn't sony patched it

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it was near hardware level

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
they couldn't be bothered and revoked it entirely

[03-Mar-20 12:50 AM] SlayerFox#7073
> why didn't sony patched it

they did... by revoking the feature that allowed for it to happen

[03-Mar-20 12:51 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it'd be like Nintendo patching fuzee gelee

[03-Mar-20 12:51 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it'd be literally impossible

[03-Mar-20 12:51 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
revoking other OS was the best they could do

[03-Mar-20 12:51 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
all people in the homebrew scene is a possibility to run their code but the consequence is  always piracy. hold on lemme find a clip that explain this

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
game devs always say mods = piracy

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] SlayerFox#7073
i mean, not all game devs

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
funny, because Nintendo also says emulation is a crime

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
and yet lost a court case against someone who legally ripped a game and played it on an emulator

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] SlayerFox#7073
it's a grey area, iirc. not expressedly legal or illegal

[03-Mar-20 12:52 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
except take two https://www.gamesradar.com/red-dead-redemption-2-gets-a-hot-coffee-mod-but-take-two-disapproves/

[03-Mar-20 12:53 AM] SlayerFox#7073
for an individual to rip and emulate a game they bought is legal

[03-Mar-20 12:53 AM] SlayerFox#7073
but to emulate a game you didn't buy is a grey area

[03-Mar-20 12:53 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
nintendo likes to flout otherwise

[03-Mar-20 12:53 AM] SlayerFox#7073
to clarify

[03-Mar-20 12:53 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I mean, let's admit it. EVERYBODY WHO USE EMULATOR PIRATE THE ISO, RIGHT?

[03-Mar-20 12:54 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
i "pirate" the game but i had previously owned a ds with pokemon platinum, a gc with sunshine, etc

[03-Mar-20 12:54 AM] SlayerFox#7073
> EVERYBODY WHO USE EMULATOR PIRATE THE ISO, RIGHT?
not necessarily.

someone had to buy the game to rip the files, thus having a non-pirated copy

[03-Mar-20 12:54 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
i own the game but can't be assed to rip it

[03-Mar-20 12:54 AM] SlayerFox#7073
on an ISO

[03-Mar-20 12:54 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I don't use the game dump of my wii games  that I can on dolphin

[03-Mar-20 12:55 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
only thing i ever ripped was the 3ds fonts

[03-Mar-20 12:55 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
for citra

[03-Mar-20 12:55 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
because you couldn't get them anywhere else

[03-Mar-20 12:55 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
@Vini Dalvino at least wii games can be easily dumped

[03-Mar-20 12:55 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

to me I pirate because I want to use a third party player

[03-Mar-20 12:56 AM] SlayerFox#7073
here's a philosophical question:

if you pirate a game that you were nevery going to buy anyways, is it stealing?
After all, the creator didn't lose money or resources by you pirating it.

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
id argue yes

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
because then you could never buy anything and always pirate

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
yes if u arent the only one who pirate else no

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] SlayerFox#7073
ah, but in this case, I said that they weren't going to get my money regardless

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
however say something not being available in your country ***jpop*** you don't really have much choice

[03-Mar-20 12:57 AM] SlayerFox#7073
indeed

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
take jpop, it's piracy but id argue its not really theft because they never would've got that money anyway

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but say that new EA game

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
shit company, but id say still theft

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] SlayerFox#7073
iirc, it's legal to pirate stuff that's not available in your country

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
no

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's not

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] SlayerFox#7073
you sure?

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] cancername#0271
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 I think pirating games you already own (I did that with GBA games) is morally ok

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
go by your own moral compass

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] SlayerFox#7073
I thought the laws on that were that it was fine up until the content became available in your nation.

[03-Mar-20 12:58 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
nope

[03-Mar-20 12:59 AM] cancername#0271
@SlayerFox that was pretty obv tho

[03-Mar-20 12:59 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
only place that states that is swiz but they just allow piracy for personal use outright

[03-Mar-20 12:59 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
so

[03-Mar-20 12:59 AM] cancername#0271
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 what's with backups / game dumps?

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
that is definitely legal

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
If there's more than one people who that pirate the content it will create loss in revenue otherwise its isn't as it's only one person.

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
pirating a game you already own depends on who you ask

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's technically illegal but honestly no one will follow you up

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's moreso a moral thing

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] cancername#0271
Pirating games(or anything, really) doesn't mean the creators are losing money

[03-Mar-20 01:00 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I have my vpn anyway

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] cancername#0271
they're just not getting money

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
even with a vpn it's moreso a moral thing

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
would you pirate, say, stardew valley

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
now would you pirate fifa 69

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] cancername#0271
fifa 69?

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] cancername#0271
lol

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Nice

[03-Mar-20 01:01 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
you get my point

[03-Mar-20 01:02 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's nearly impossible for laws to regulate this kind of thing so it's moreso for you to decide morally what to do

[03-Mar-20 01:02 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
of course if you just go onto tpb and torrent everything you see that's up to you

[03-Mar-20 01:03 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
> would you pirate, say, stardew valley
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 what if I am poor, or just give the game back to country who are in development by seeding the pirated game

[03-Mar-20 01:03 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
as i said

[03-Mar-20 01:03 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
up to you

[03-Mar-20 01:04 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but id think less of you compared to you, say, torrenting fifa

[03-Mar-20 01:04 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
also fun fact most people who pirate state the reason they pirate is not cost

[03-Mar-20 01:04 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's usually availability, then an issue with existing services, then disagreeing with the company

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
then cost

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] cancername#0271
I usually pirate books or old games I own but want in digital form

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
id argue old games are free real estate tbh

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
they aren't being sold anymore

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
To me I pirate music and video so I have a better video player

[03-Mar-20 01:05 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
therefore availablility

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] cancername#0271
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 well, nintendo aint you

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
nintendo are backwards

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
Honesty if they went the Sega route and just straight out sold the roms id buy it tbh

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] cancername#0271
@Vini Dalvino Do you mean you pirate video players or films?

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Sega do this?

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
Yes

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
@cancername films.

[03-Mar-20 01:06 AM] cancername#0271
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 me too.

[03-Mar-20 01:07 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
You can buy the roms to all of the old sonic games on steam

[03-Mar-20 01:07 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
You can use their emulator or take it out of the game folder and use it in your own

[03-Mar-20 01:07 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Is there any other games?

[03-Mar-20 01:07 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I'm not into sonic

[03-Mar-20 01:07 AM] cancername#0271
@Vini Dalvino tbh you can just get them from a rom site if ur careful

[03-Mar-20 01:08 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
@cancername I use a UserScript for emu paradise

[03-Mar-20 01:08 AM] cancername#0271
@Vini Dalvino wht's dat

[03-Mar-20 01:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
>if ur careful
unless you live in china law enforcement does not care about you downloading a game from 2002 illegally then say uploading a game

[03-Mar-20 01:08 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
It's like a smaller plugin for your browser

[03-Mar-20 01:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
uploading and downloading aren't equal in the eyes of the law

[03-Mar-20 01:10 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
There's still nintendo game on emu paradise. You just need the user script and to swatch your games.

[03-Mar-20 01:11 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
What is c&d

[03-Mar-20 01:11 AM] SlayerFox#7073

🗿 is the WORST emoji!

It's horrendous and ugly. I hate it. The point of emojis is to show emotions, but what emotion does this show? Do you just wake up in the morning and think "wow, I really feel like a massive fucking stone today"? It's useless. I hate it. It just provokes a deep rooted anger within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and kill it. If this was the emoji movie I'd push it off a fucking cliff. People just comment 🗿 as if it's funny. It's not. 🗿 deserves to die. He deserves to have his smug little stone face smashed in with a hammer. Oh wow, it's a stone head, how fucking hilarious, I'll use it in every comment I post. NO. STOP IT. It deserves to burn in hell. Why is it so goddamn smug. You're a fucking stone, you have no life goals, you will never accomplish anything in life apart from pissing me off. When you die no one will mourn. I hope you die.

[03-Mar-20 01:43 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[03-Mar-20 05:53 PM] XPHonza#1111

[03-Mar-20 05:53 PM] XPHonza#1111

[03-Mar-20 05:53 PM] peanut#9631
badlion isnt even partnered on discord

[03-Mar-20 05:53 PM] XPHonza#1111

impact is a mod though? by definition?

[03-Mar-20 06:57 PM] Arisa#5591
Yes

[03-Mar-20 06:57 PM] Pixelated_#5846
you see, the joke is that saying “utility” client or implying that your mod provides little to no advantage like optifine is facetious

[03-Mar-20 06:57 PM] aholic#5657
Why is sernior moderator playing osu?.????

[03-Mar-20 06:57 PM] aholic#5657
Demote

[03-Mar-20 06:58 PM] Ilidumb#0285
impact does provide utility
the comparison to optifine was because optifine is a mod

[03-Mar-20 10:19 PM] SlayerFox#7073
Pingspoof?

[03-Mar-20 10:20 PM] Olexorus#5455
it gave you a fake 2000ms or so ping

[03-Mar-20 10:21 PM] SlayerFox#7073
Oh, I get what your on about now.
It's called something else now, but I cannot remember what.

[03-Mar-20 10:22 PM] Olexorus#5455
I found the lag module, but it doesn't seem to be the right one

[03-Mar-20 10:22 PM] SlayerFox#7073

[03-Mar-20 10:23 PM] Olexorus#5455

also there used to be a slider to configure the amount of lag, that's not there

there is obviosly another condition that if you pass wont kick you @Arisa like loading chunks right?

[03-Mar-20 11:26 PM] Arisa#5591
I dont think so

[03-Mar-20 11:26 PM] Arisa#5591
but I cant know for sure

[03-Mar-20 11:27 PM] XPHonza#1111
then why can baritone go for hours without breaking blocks in nether?

[03-Mar-20 11:28 PM] Arisa#5591
maybe it has thing that when you travel some amount of blocks in some time

[03-Mar-20 11:28 PM] Arisa#5591
idk

[03-Mar-20 11:28 PM] Arisa#5591
I can't know that

[03-Mar-20 11:28 PM] Arisa#5591
and nobody really

[03-Mar-20 11:28 PM] Arisa#5591
only who made the plugin

or who can see the source code of it

[03-Mar-20 11:30 PM] positive#4202
loading chunks being taken into consideration would definitely lead to false kicks

[03-Mar-20 11:36 PM] GamerMD | ΛZURΣ#8752
In the impact you can add an option of "entitatedesync dismount / remount"
it would be useful

One of the ip loggers (can't remember which one) can grab a shit ton of info, including device orientation and OS.

that's basic shit your webbrowser know on you

I don't care too much if it gets nabbed, but it rubs me the wrong way when people *want* that kinda info.

[04-Mar-20 03:42 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
these channel descriptions are not executed 100% by higher staff. you need to learn the soft-rules applied by the actual staff vs. the rules that are written down

[04-Mar-20 03:42 PM] Ilidumb#0285
yeah!

[04-Mar-20 03:42 PM] Seven Oaks#5555

if you cheat on skyblock it's just to speed up your own progress you dont harm anyone

[04-Mar-20 04:29 PM] XPHonza#1111
if you don't use any obvious utilities then the probability of you getting banned is low

so theres no problem with bypassing anticheat or anything hypixel has implemented to ban cheaters @XPHonza

[04-Mar-20 04:32 PM] Ilidumb#0285
he said "if you don't use obvious cheats"

[04-Mar-20 04:32 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
its discouraged to use impact as a cheat and everything you do in that regard is on your own terms

Donations using the new system activate instantly on your Discord and Minecraft accounts. If you donated through the old system (I'm sorry), it can take up to 72 hours to be processed. If you forgot to include your discord or minecraft accounts in the payment note or message please DM @Brady.

my 2 cents is don't tell people to kill themselves anyways (unless you know them) cuz you *could* be charged with manslaughter if they do commit suicide later.

@SlayerFox Their effect on preventing you from getting sars2 is low(*not* nonexistant), even when cobined with goggles, whereas it does prevent you from spreading the disease well, which in turn makes them useful.

Best way to kill mankind with a virus is this:

Create a virus that is air/liquid spreading, maybe by touch too, but does not do anything special that is noticable, not coughing, no Syndroms basically.

Release the virus in the middle of the Chinese new year event, let the Chinese poeple travelling do their thing, have the virus on every continent within 24 hours, and have people infected in every country within like a week to month.

Impact is good at modifying gameplay

[05-Mar-20 07:39 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
is it a meme answer or a honest one

[05-Mar-20 07:39 AM] BongEatBong#3591
honest answer

[05-Mar-20 07:40 AM] BongEatBong#3591
though even leijurv disagrees with my memeworthy opinion

[05-Mar-20 07:40 AM] BongEatBong#3591
leaf agrees tho cuz he's big brain

[05-Mar-20 07:40 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I somewhat agree. I can't live without the module where it allow you to walk while your  inventory is  opened.

Suggesting _what_? And what are you expecting discord mods to do about an issue on GH?

[05-Mar-20 07:55 AM] Arisa#5591
so that would never happen

[05-Mar-20 07:55 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
a reaction role that people react to which will add them a role where impact bot reply will not pop up

[05-Mar-20 07:56 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
and mine is that an list of whitelist url embed

[05-Mar-20 07:58 AM] LeafHacker#5373
Ok, so why are you moaning that some mods are _ignoring_ issues on GH? Assuming they even know how to code, and know impact bots code base, people work on what they want not what you want

[05-Mar-20 07:58 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
seem fair

is there a way to set an area in which i want to kill mobs

[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bench#3813
with baritone (hunt) ?

[05-Mar-20 04:20 PM] jasonn#8605
hunt is for players

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
@BigBoy

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
use .b goal

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
then .b path

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
.b goal 100 60 100

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
for example

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468
then .b path should path you there

[05-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Epoch#0468

[05-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bench#3813

[05-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bench#3813
to hunt for them

[05-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bench#3813

There are certain graphical frontends for FFmpeg, but I recommend you use the command-line version

I'd like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself,  but  rather another free component of a fully functiooning GNU system made useful by gnu core lib, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. @Wumpus

[05-Mar-20 09:49 PM] Wumpus#0002
I understood 5% of the bible about linux you just wrote

[05-Mar-20 09:51 PM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Though a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNu is widdely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. @Wumpus

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine resources to the other programs that you run, but useless by itsself; it can only function in the GNU operating system: : the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so called

I already released a video of the Dial Up Sound for 1 Hour...and I was told it was just too short. Hitting replay over and over again is annoying, so I decided to upload this 56K Modem Sound 10 Hours video. There's nothing more nostalgic from the 90's than the classic Dial-Up ...

No, Richard, it's 'Linux', not 'GNU/Linux'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.

"I use Linux as my operating system," I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision. "Actually", he says with a grin, "Linux is just the kernel. You use GNU+Linux!' I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, "I use Alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."

The smile quickly drops from the man's face. His body begins convulsing and he foams at the mouth and drops to the floor with a sickly thud. As he writhes around he screams "I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL GNU!" Coolly, I reply "If windows was compiled with gcc, would that make it GNU?" I interrupt his response with "-and work is being made on the kernel to make it more compiler-agnostic. Even you were correct, you wont be for long."

With a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body. He lies on the floor, cold and limp. I've womansplained him to death.

[05-Mar-20 10:06 PM] archbtw#6699
No, Richard, it's 'Linux', not 'GNU/Linux'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.
Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ.
One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Linux is an OS -- more on this later). He named it 'Linux' with a little help from his friends. Why doesn't he call it GNU/Linux? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don't want to be known as a nag, do you?
(An operating system) != (a distribution). Linux is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Linux in use. However, Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system, a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Linux (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title 'GNU/Linux' (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.

@Vini Dalvino if you're using architect at that point use arch

[06-Mar-20 04:30 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
id argue installing arch is less retarded then manjaro Architect install

[06-Mar-20 04:30 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
that and you don't have to deal with manjaro breaking your shit every update 🦍

otherwise it breaks a fuck ton

[06-Mar-20 04:36 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
One thing which I'm sure about is that I'm going to tinker

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
the sole reason i switched to arch was because npm broke itself **again**

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
i don't even use npm

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
so you cant say "USER ERRROR!!1!"

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Real programmer code cpp

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's the distro itself

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
fuck off kek

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Lmao

[06-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
literally check the forums

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
npm shitting itself isn't uncommon

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
same for pip

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] Arisa#5591
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 YOURE STUPID FOR REAL

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yes, say user error for npm breaking when i haven't touched npm

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
of course

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
@Arisa what's he's speaking about

[06-Mar-20 04:38 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
and why he is stupid

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
@Vini Dalvino basically, she's saying that the reason a package broke is user error even though ive never explicitly used the package, it's solely a dependency

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
im pretty sure that's the distros fault

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but ok

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
sure

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
arisa is always correct

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Well you technically used the package as it's a dependency. It's a user error.

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
if it works for arisa, it's not a bug

[06-Mar-20 04:39 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
@Vini Dalvino nope lmfao

[06-Mar-20 04:40 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
user error is doing something retarded

[06-Mar-20 04:40 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
leaving a package and doing nothing to it should not break it

[06-Mar-20 04:40 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yet here we are

[06-Mar-20 04:41 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Anyway this is why you should use heavily sandboxed language like lua ⛪ ✝️/s

[06-Mar-20 04:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
🗿

[06-Mar-20 04:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
anyway

[06-Mar-20 04:41 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
if you aren't using nodejs or python you should be fine

[06-Mar-20 04:42 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
those are the only two packages off the top  of my head that are a pain in the fucking ass

[06-Mar-20 04:42 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
that and openjfx

[06-Mar-20 04:42 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
if you thought canonical was bad, holy fuck

[06-Mar-20 04:42 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I plan to use your node js rpc.

[06-Mar-20 04:42 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

for one

[06-Mar-20 04:43 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

lmfao

[06-Mar-20 04:43 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
What programming language do you know aside from js

[06-Mar-20 04:43 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
python

[06-Mar-20 05:08 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Is it included with manjaro

[06-Mar-20 05:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
wdym

[06-Mar-20 05:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's not "included" with arch either

[06-Mar-20 05:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
if youre using pacman

[06-Mar-20 05:08 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
for the love of god please use yay

[06-Mar-20 05:09 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
also the aur is inherently less safe then the arch or manjaro repos

[06-Mar-20 05:09 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
prefer main, extra or community branches over the aur if possible

[06-Mar-20 05:10 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Why would I want to use another package manager. Wouldn't it be simpler to use the included package manager? Oh wait wouldn't it be like me using choco instead of the Microsoft store?

[06-Mar-20 05:11 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yay is a wrapper for pacman

[06-Mar-20 05:11 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
as you'll find out pacman does the job but it's pretty scuffed

[06-Mar-20 05:11 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
for one, installing from the aur is a bit annoying

[06-Mar-20 05:11 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
that and you having to memorise an alphabet soup

[06-Mar-20 05:11 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Are you talking about repo or package manager? I'm lost.

[06-Mar-20 05:12 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yay is a wrapper for pacman, ie it literally just wraps pacman and makes things easier like installing from the aur and searching packages

[06-Mar-20 05:12 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Anyway, we'll talk about this tomorrow. You need to sleep.

[06-Mar-20 05:12 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
pacman can't install from the aur unless you explicitly tell it to

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
by giving it a url and then mkpkg

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I'm arleady used to CLI for package manager due to me using choco

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
tldr just use yay

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Choco is based (does this mean that it's good)

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
yes

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
use yay

[06-Mar-20 05:13 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
It have a lot of package. Even chrome

[06-Mar-20 05:14 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
aur theoretically has every single possible package

How to Add a Swap File on an Arch Linux Cloud Server | DigitalOcean
In this article, we will discuss how to add a swap file to an Arch Linux cloud server. Linux uses swap spaces to offload information from the machine's RAM, allowing for the most important processes more resources to operate.

[06-Mar-20 05:26 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
make a swap file after install

(also as a sidenote using arch on a server is incredibly retarded)

[06-Mar-20 05:27 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
what commands specifically

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
set-alias

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
unless they're system commands it literally shouldn't make a difference

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
set-alias is just alias

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
I know that PowerShell is heavily based off Unix command

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
LOL

[06-Mar-20 05:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
ps is a joke honestly

[06-Mar-20 05:29 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
you can set aliases with alias but they need to be added to your .zshrc file

[06-Mar-20 05:29 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
Why though? Cmd is a joke. If Microsoft do a change to it the application can break very easily

[06-Mar-20 05:29 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342
@『EmeraldSnorlax』 😫

[06-Mar-20 05:29 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
>if Microsoft do a change everything breaks

this is why you don't use windows

[06-Mar-20 05:30 AM] Vini Dalvino#8342

[06-Mar-20 05:30 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
ps is just a fancy wrapper for cmd

[06-Mar-20 05:30 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
they use the same shell

[06-Mar-20 05:30 AM] Ice#0002

What you are saying is basically that arch and manjaro repo have a high amount of package?

[06-Mar-20 05:40 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
manjaro repos is just arch repos but delayed by 2 weeks

[06-Mar-20 05:40 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

nightcore is

[06-Mar-20 06:51 AM] Battery Settings#2396
Exactly

[06-Mar-20 06:51 AM] Battery Settings#2396

[06-Mar-20 06:51 AM] Battery Settings#2396
Exceptions apply

[06-Mar-20 06:51 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
how to make nightcore:
1) speedup by 2x
2) pitch shift everything 20 octaves higher
3) add a drum beat you found off of freesounds

I need to kill you
That's the only way to get you out of my head

To silence all the sweet little things you've said
I really wanna kill you
Wipe you off the face of my earth
And bury your bracelet
Bury your bracelet
Six feet under the dirt

[06-Mar-20 11:41 AM] is slef#0420
is there anyway to get 1.15.2 without donating like server boosting or something

[06-Mar-20 11:42 AM] ObiJuan_#6680
That's a question for Brady himself

[06-Mar-20 11:42 AM] ObiJuan_#6680
My guess would be probably not

[06-Mar-20 11:42 AM] Indrit#0001
Sorry server boosting is already taken Care of Xd

[06-Mar-20 11:43 AM] ObiJuan_#6680
And Brady probably isn't up at this hour anyway

[06-Mar-20 11:43 AM] ObiJuan_#6680
