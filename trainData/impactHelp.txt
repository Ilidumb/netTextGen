@Symetry so...? are you sure it was $5 usd not 8? because i have an 8 usd donation from 2 minutes earlier, that isnt you?

[29-Feb-20 07:23 AM] Symetry#6068
I had 8 selected originally but moved it back to 5 because I saw it was autoconverting from AUD to USD. I don’t mind if I donated more, just wondering if I could get access to premium or not 🤷‍♂️

Donations using the new system activate instantly on your Discord and Minecraft accounts. If you donated through the old system (I'm sorry), it can take up to 72 hours to be processed. If you forgot to include your discord or minecraft accounts in the payment note or message please DM @Unknown.

what did the main menu of the game look like

[29-Feb-20 11:08 AM] xpielordx#9848
because im wondering if youre even using impact

[29-Feb-20 11:08 AM] xpielordx#9848
either that or you set your impact command prefix to something else

[29-Feb-20 11:08 AM] Blawsh#4128
normal mc with text in corner

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] xpielordx#9848

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] Blawsh#4128
impact

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] xpielordx#9848
ok, well it looks like it was the latter case then

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] xpielordx#9848
your prefix is set to something else

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] xpielordx#9848
do you happen to remember what that could've been?

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] Blawsh#4128
how do i check

[29-Feb-20 11:09 AM] Blawsh#4128
no lol

[29-Feb-20 11:13 AM] xpielordx#9848
checking some files real quick, one sec

[29-Feb-20 11:13 AM] Blawsh#4128
ugh

[29-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xpielordx#9848
easiest way since you dont remember your prefix would be to delete the `Impact/` directory

[29-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xpielordx#9848
then relaunch

[29-Feb-20 11:14 AM] Blawsh#4128
1 min

[29-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xpielordx#9848
this would be so that you can get the default config

fyi a donator benefit is that you get access to nightly builds of impact, which means you will receive updates much faster than the normal release channel

[29-Feb-20 11:29 AM] Blawsh#4128

no

no, to use multiple accounts at the same time on the same server you would need to launch multiple seperate instances of impact

[29-Feb-20 01:15 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Ask trump for schematics , then mail them to jurv , he will then program it into bariton

[29-Feb-20 01:16 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Or you can also just do `.b help` in-game and look at your options

[29-Feb-20 04:07 PM] Legardus#5747

@『EmeraldSnorlax』 Yea

[01-Mar-20 01:27 AM] cancername#0271
@Xoyaral Signing the exe is like signing a document: You slap your signature on it so you can prove it's yours. Microsoft is doing that with Windows applications: If it's not signed by MS, it will pop up that annoying message. So, to get MS's signature, you have to buy it. And that costs a fuck ton of money

[01-Mar-20 01:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
it's M$ milking more money out of people

[01-Mar-20 01:28 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
because stalking you and plastering ads on the start menu and charging 100$ for the os just isn't enough

If you have the knowledge, use a free OS. If not, you're out of luck

[01-Mar-20 01:32 AM] LeafHacker#5373
Not 100% accurate; we'd never be able to sign anything with MS key, but we can get our own key and sign stuff. The hard/expensive part is getting our key listed by someone Microsoft trusts. That is usually a paid subscription.

[01-Mar-20 01:34 AM] LeafHacker#5373
(technically, our key would be split into private and public keys; the private key is used to sign stuff and the public key is used to verify the signature. The public key would be listed publicly by an "authority" that MS trusts and we pay, the private key would be top secret)

[01-Mar-20 01:34 AM] LeafHacker#5373
_my understanding_ is that if we did that then the security warning would probably go away.

I forced 4 baritone-bots to dig mine for diamonds in minecraft
I thought: "What if I run 4 copies of Minecraft with built-in A.I. "Baritone" and make them dig a mine looking for diamonds". In this video, I put my thought into action. Enjoy!

I've found out that it's Optifine I need a fix for it.

[01-Mar-20 01:32 PM] peanut#9631
remove it then

[01-Mar-20 01:32 PM] peanut#9631
optifine is not supported by us

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] BadFCA#3260
I need a fix WITHOUT removing it.

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] peanut#9631
there is none

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] peanut#9631
expect graphical errors when running optifine

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] BadFCA#3260
Why have I seen ppl use Optifine & Impact

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] BadFCA#3260
there's even instructions for it

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] peanut#9631
yes there is

[01-Mar-20 01:33 PM] peanut#9631
but since youve run a modpack, there can be a lot of reasons why its not working

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] BadFCA#3260
The only reason is optifine

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
possibly optifine not cooperating with mods

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] BadFCA#3260
It's just optifine

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
yes, its just optifine

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
but youve loaded a modpack

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
there are like 200 more mods there

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] BadFCA#3260
Wait.

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
and possibly optifine causes errors with others

[01-Mar-20 01:34 PM] peanut#9631
thus impact not rendering the strings

[01-Mar-20 01:35 PM] BadFCA#3260
uh

[01-Mar-20 01:35 PM] peanut#9631
also i strongly advise against using impact in a modpack

[01-Mar-20 01:35 PM] BadFCA#3260
I just removed Optifine started the game it works, then I shut the game down then I added Optifine back now it's working.

[01-Mar-20 01:35 PM] peanut#9631
then its a problem on your side

[01-Mar-20 01:35 PM] BadFCA#3260
Read it

[01-Mar-20 01:36 PM] BadFCA#3260
@peanut so I removed it & added it back (Optifine) and now it works.

That's the third time you have asked this question in here, again with a different name.
Explain what you want exactly or honestly stop.

What would be the set command for setting speed to float?

[01-Mar-20 03:22 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
@TobSick use the click GUI if your talking abt speed module-modes

[01-Mar-20 03:23 PM] TobSick#3449
I want to be able to make it a macro though, is that possible?

[01-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
I'd imagine that would be possible, I'm not at my computer atm tho. You can try to use .help speed (the output of that) in combination with the macro menu in the pause screen

[01-Mar-20 03:30 PM] TobSick#3449
k, is there a set enable true command (not toggle)

[01-Mar-20 04:09 PM] KirbyCat#8083
when i load into impact nothing on the screen renders, is there anything i can do to fix that?

[01-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Seven Oaks#5555

@antihackerbg if it's the crouching backwards bug, that has been reported before and is a known bug and new opened issues will be closed as duplicates.
If not go ahead and use the bots message as your answer.

no. it jumped into lava.

@𝕊𝕊𝔾_𝕋𝕣𝕚𝕒𝕕𝕤 There is 0 available utility in terms of plugins that make it possible to read your client, otherwise people wouldn't be able.to join hypixel or skyblock with this. It is an issue on your end, try to disable all modules and if your running optifine remove it.

Baritone is designed to avoid water by default. Thats going to prove rather difficult

baritone cant build from water

[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Arisa#5591
simple

[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Arisa#5591
you can make it build a floor from celing

and put ice on top of it

[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Arisa#5591

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
I think

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
it downloads always same json

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
even for public installer

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
it has nightly

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
but it doesnt show them

[01-Mar-20 06:13 PM] Arisa#5591
so if it wouldnt download the json

[01-Mar-20 06:14 PM] Arisa#5591
there wouldnt be any version

[01-Mar-20 06:14 PM] Arisa#5591

Just paranoid is all. Im just hoping to go on 2B2T for the first time ever after watching several videos by FitMC. A lot of people say you need a moddified* client to play that server.

[02-Mar-20 06:37 AM] SlayerFox#7073
you don't *need* one per-say

[02-Mar-20 06:37 AM] SlayerFox#7073
it's just that everyone else you ever meet on the server has about a 90% chance of using one

Ok another question how do you change the mode of a module using .set?

[02-Mar-20 07:07 AM] SlayerFox#7073
> damn
why are you upset? ``.t <module>`` is infinitely faster to type than ``.set <module> enabled true``

is it possible to make a script or something that for example sets a waypoint when there is an enderchest nearby?

[02-Mar-20 06:00 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
#goto ender_chest

[02-Mar-20 06:00 PM] Seven Oaks#5555

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] vaxer#1414
i am autoexploring with baritone

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] vaxer#1414
and I want it to autoset a waypoint whenever it finds an echest

[02-Mar-20 06:01 PM] vaxer#1414
so i can leave it running for hours for example and get a bunch of waypoints

[02-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Sounds like stashfinder from some other (I think backmemed but don't quote me) client

[02-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
You can try and make it work but it's not there

[02-Mar-20 06:05 PM] Ilidumb#0285
very good idea for a module though

[02-Mar-20 06:57 PM] vaxer#1414
@Ilidumb no please

[02-Mar-20 06:57 PM] vaxer#1414
@Seven Oaks wdym try and make it work, impact isnt open source, is it?

[02-Mar-20 08:19 PM] Ilidumb#0285
what do you mean you can't see it? are you sure you didn't just run off the hud? what other mods are you using?

[02-Mar-20 08:22 PM] XR#3101
well I can't see the Impact hud

[02-Mar-20 08:23 PM] Ilidumb#0285
press right-shift and turn hud back on

Ty for taking care of m ping

[02-Mar-20 08:28 PM] XR#3101
neither option does anything

[02-Mar-20 08:28 PM] XR#3101
I checked the mod menu and it doesn't show Impact

[02-Mar-20 08:28 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Is the watermark on the main menu?

[02-Mar-20 08:28 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Ok prob not then

[02-Mar-20 08:28 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Then you scuffed the install somehow

[02-Mar-20 08:29 PM] XR#3101
it's the correct version but I have no idea where I'm supposed to put the file

[02-Mar-20 08:29 PM] XR#3101
it doesn't work in the mod folder so idk

[02-Mar-20 08:30 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Use the installer?

[02-Mar-20 08:30 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
It does work if the installer installs it into the mod folder

[02-Mar-20 08:30 PM] XR#3101
it installed it in the .minecraft folder

[02-Mar-20 08:30 PM] XR#3101
but not the mod folder

[02-Mar-20 08:31 PM] XR#3101
I've tried both and neither work

Hi there 🙂 Sorry for asking while there's an open question.
Having some issues with auto bow aim. It keeps aiming at entities that are not in sight; entities in caves underneath me, etc. Any idea how I can fix this, please?

[02-Mar-20 08:32 PM] XR#3101
OK NVM. I fixed it myself

[02-Mar-20 08:40 PM] Seven Oaks#5555

[02-Mar-20 08:45 PM] Killa#7526
Don't see a range slider for the Bow Aimbot. Does it work together with the other aimbot? Normal aimbot has a range value, but is currently off. Version 1.14.4

[02-Mar-20 08:49 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Smooth aim has range, I'm pretty Shure normal one does too?

[02-Mar-20 09:24 PM] cancername#0271
@SmackBlox 
1. download iso of fav distro
2. Etcher
3. Boot from usb

[02-Mar-20 09:24 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 09:24 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
windows 10 is malware but meh

[02-Mar-20 09:24 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857

[02-Mar-20 09:24 PM] SmackBlox#7536

I'm just telling him to make a live usb so he can decide whether to do dual boot or run live or install on the whole HDD or whatever

[02-Mar-20 09:27 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
> I'm just telling him to make a live usb so he can decide whether to do dual boot or run live or install on the whole HDD or whatever
pretty shure he doesnt have the mental capacity to do that

[02-Mar-20 09:27 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
fair point

[02-Mar-20 09:28 PM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
but if he went through the effort to downgrade because 10 was ***that bad*** then he probably does

:thonk:

[02-Mar-20 09:28 PM] cancername#0271

i agree arch is great for learning and knowing linux
but some people want and or need a functioning OS on their computer and dont want to tinker with shit for one and a half days because theyve never used a terminal

[02-Mar-20 09:35 PM] archbtw#6699
Windows users coming to linux want a welcoming experience, having their first impression be a blank terminal will only make things worse

My friend is trying to download impact, but when he tries to click on the download link it comes up with This Application requires a Java runtime environment 1,8

[02-Mar-20 10:17 PM] moonraker00#8754
Does any one know the issue?

[02-Mar-20 10:48 PM] 1604318235#3455
没有这个填写账户的选项
我先进入impact官网 我看见先捐赠5$才能获得 我就直接付钱了
然后弹出一个网页让我输入邮箱 密码 和我minecraft的id 
就这些

[02-Mar-20 10:48 PM] 1604318235#3455
There is no option to fill in the account

I'll go to the impact website first, and I'll pay directly when I see that I can only get 5 dollars from donation

Then a webpage will pop up for me to enter my email password and my minecraft ID

That's all

[03-Mar-20 02:47 AM] TobSick#3449
So, no...?

[03-Mar-20 02:48 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
depends on what you wanna do with it

[03-Mar-20 02:48 AM] TobSick#3449
I want, as a line in a macro, for it to do a right click. Is this possible?

[03-Mar-20 02:49 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
auto...clicker?

[03-Mar-20 02:50 AM] TobSick#3449
ok, then. Is it possible to add a line to a macro where it jumps, as in presses space?

[03-Mar-20 02:51 AM] Seven Oaks#5555

Go on the [website](https://impactclient.net/#donate) to donate.
Donations using the new system activate instantly on your Discord and Minecraft accounts. If you donated through the old system (I'm sorry), it can take up to 72 hours to be processed.

@archbtw so slight problem - intellij wants openjdk but you said baritone wont build under openjdk

[03-Mar-20 04:03 AM] archbtw#6699
is openjdk marked as a dependency for intellij]

[03-Mar-20 04:05 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
No, because intellij is a snap

[03-Mar-20 04:05 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
@archbtw

[03-Mar-20 04:08 AM] Battery Settings#2396

[03-Mar-20 05:28 AM] Arisa#5591
You can use pure gradle

[03-Mar-20 05:28 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264

[03-Mar-20 05:34 AM] Arisa#5591

[03-Mar-20 05:36 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
And the guy that helped me said yeah

[03-Mar-20 05:37 AM] Arisa#5591
Well, in reality it's Impact related only

if your project is in that

[03-Mar-20 05:58 AM] Arisa#5591
or maven

[03-Mar-20 05:58 AM] Arisa#5591
it's easy

[03-Mar-20 05:58 AM] Arisa#5591
and then you can call the baritoneapi

[03-Mar-20 05:58 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
I figured that out

[03-Mar-20 05:59 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
I just need more help with interfacing the API into other stuff so thats why a baritone discord would be helpful

[03-Mar-20 06:00 AM] Arisa#5591
????

[03-Mar-20 06:01 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
@Arisa so basically I have a thing called pycraft, its a python interface with minecraft, and i need the baritone api to work with it

[03-Mar-20 06:01 AM] Arisa#5591
BRUH

[03-Mar-20 06:01 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
wat

[03-Mar-20 06:01 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
its reasonable

[03-Mar-20 06:02 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
but something that def needs to be in a baritone-specific server

[03-Mar-20 06:02 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
since you guys only care about the client and not baritone

[03-Mar-20 06:02 AM] Arisa#5591
I'm not sure how pycract works but it seems like it's python api for some java minecraft thingie

[03-Mar-20 06:02 AM] Arisa#5591
so you wont make offiicial baritoneapi work with that

[03-Mar-20 06:03 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
but i kinda need it to ._.

[03-Mar-20 06:03 AM] Arisa#5591
Well

[03-Mar-20 06:03 AM] Arisa#5591
dont use python

[03-Mar-20 06:03 AM] Arisa#5591
imagine using Python on top of Java

[03-Mar-20 06:03 AM] Arisa#5591
🤮

[03-Mar-20 06:04 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
There's no Java proxy iirc that does what i need

[03-Mar-20 06:04 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
And if there is all of my code is already in PyCraft

[03-Mar-20 06:04 AM] Arisa#5591
well you choosed very badly what to use for your project

[03-Mar-20 06:04 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
i ddidnt choose

[03-Mar-20 06:04 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
it was my dev team ._.

[03-Mar-20 06:05 AM] Arisa#5591
Dev team?

[03-Mar-20 06:05 AM] Arisa#5591
very bad one

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
I could go yell at them if you find a better one made in Java'

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
What?

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
Use normal java?

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
or

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
Yeah

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
And have it be able to use Baritone ._.

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
sec I will google what exactly is pycraft

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
```Minecraft Python Client Library!

This projects aims to be a modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for communication with a MineCraft server.```

[03-Mar-20 06:06 AM] Arisa#5591
🤣

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] Arisa#5591
I mean

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] Arisa#5591
everything is possible

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] Arisa#5591
but to make baritone work with that

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] Arisa#5591
is almost impossible(you would need to rewrite everything kek(creating your own whole thing but with the same algorithms etc..))

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
I found a client that might work better

[03-Mar-20 06:08 AM] ProgrammerPlays#8264
Ill yet at my team

[03-Mar-20 06:09 AM] Arisa#5591
don't yell at them

[03-Mar-20 06:09 AM] Arisa#5591
that never helps

[03-Mar-20 06:09 AM] Arisa#5591
try to find solution together

[03-Mar-20 07:50 AM] Arisa#5591

well you can open cmd and type `java -jar <path_to_installer> --no-gpg` that should fix it

[03-Mar-20 11:25 AM] Arisa#5591
@xxkmatiasxx No

[03-Mar-20 11:30 AM] Arisa#5591
@slumplean you must replace `<path_to_installer>` with valid path

[03-Mar-20 11:30 AM] Arisa#5591
to the file installer

[03-Mar-20 11:31 AM] slumplean#8285
ah the file path?

[03-Mar-20 11:31 AM] slumplean#8285
yessir ok

[03-Mar-20 11:31 AM] Arisa#5591
ye, where the file is in the system

[03-Mar-20 11:31 AM] Arisa#5591
eg C:/sdskksd/sfafasf/fasfas/installer.exe

[03-Mar-20 11:40 AM] Arisa#5591
oh without the `<`  `>`

[03-Mar-20 11:40 AM] Arisa#5591
also java before it

[03-Mar-20 11:40 AM] Arisa#5591
also you have to specify the extensions of the file

[03-Mar-20 11:40 AM] Arisa#5591
Hmm

[03-Mar-20 11:40 AM] Arisa#5591
I have idea open file explorer

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
find the installer

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
and click into that top bar

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
and copy it

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
and paste it here

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
then screenshot the folder with the installer

[03-Mar-20 11:41 AM] Arisa#5591
and I will write the whole command for you

[03-Mar-20 11:47 AM] slumplean#8285
lol ok, this is the best tech support i ever had

[03-Mar-20 11:51 AM] slumplean#8285
C:\Users\piema\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

[03-Mar-20 11:52 AM] Arisa#5591
thats where you downloaded the impact installer? (just to be sure)

[03-Mar-20 11:53 AM] slumplean#8285
tbh i have no clue i just clicked install lastnight and it worked. this might be a lost cause bc i literaaly dont have a clue of whats going on

[03-Mar-20 11:54 AM] slumplean#8285
thats the file path it gives me inside the installer

[03-Mar-20 11:54 AM] Arisa#5591
well, the error you're getting means it cant veirfy the the file that can be caused by a few things, 
also I need you to download eg the installer on your desktop

[03-Mar-20 11:55 AM] Arisa#5591
and open there the file explorer

[03-Mar-20 11:56 AM] slumplean#8285
ok i have the installer pulled up

[03-Mar-20 11:56 AM] slumplean#8285
whats eg?

[03-Mar-20 11:57 AM] Arisa#5591
for example

[03-Mar-20 11:57 AM] slumplean#8285
ok

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
so now you have it on desktop, so open the File Explorer, and find your desktop with the file impact installer

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
then look in that window of file explorer on top

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
there should be long bar

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
into that you can click

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
there will be text which is parth to directory

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
I need you to copy that one

[03-Mar-20 11:58 AM] Arisa#5591
and paste it here

[03-Mar-20 11:59 AM] Arisa#5591
and then screenshot name of the impact installer file

[03-Mar-20 11:59 AM] slumplean#8285
ok

[03-Mar-20 12:00 PM] Arisa#5591
I think if you have it on desktop and you downloaded latest exe impact installer

[03-Mar-20 12:00 PM] Arisa#5591
then it very likely will be ```java -jar "C:\Users\piema\Desktop\ImpactInstaller-0.8.4.exe" --no-gpg```

[03-Mar-20 12:01 PM] Arisa#5591
but I cant be sure when I dont see it

[03-Mar-20 12:05 PM] slumplean#8285

[03-Mar-20 12:05 PM] Arisa#5591
but I dont say open Impact installer

[03-Mar-20 12:06 PM] Arisa#5591
I say open File Explorer

[03-Mar-20 12:06 PM] Arisa#5591
the program in which you can browse your files and folders on disk

[03-Mar-20 12:06 PM] Arisa#5591

[03-Mar-20 11:36 PM] archbtw#6699

can impact improve fps?

[04-Mar-20 02:11 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
no but you can try running it with optifine

[04-Mar-20 02:11 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
its unstable but theoretically should work

[04-Mar-20 02:38 AM] Val#1156
running it with optifine isn't very buggy

[04-Mar-20 02:38 AM] Val#1156
xray is broken in 1.14.4 though

[04-Mar-20 02:45 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
unstable as in "theres about 5 people in here every day saying their mc crashes and uninstalling optifine fixes it" unstable

[04-Mar-20 02:48 AM] Val#1156
Ah, mine runs fine

#pause

use either
``#pause``
or ``.b pause``

[04-Mar-20 04:07 AM] Gazpacho#3629
I put again materials and does nothing, I can not use the .resume, only when I break a block under it, replace it

[04-Mar-20 04:07 AM] archbtw#6699

You give money to Brady or do the ungodly work of staff until one day you might get lucky
Aside from donating there's no consistent way of getting a role

also attachments and external emojis role

[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] XPHonza#1111

As soon as you've been given your role you'll get access to #donator-info and thats where you get the donator installer for 1.15.2

Impact does not support cracked launchers. You can attempt to use the unstable Forge version, but no further support will be provided.

[04-Mar-20 10:59 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
Impact is a mod. You need to own Minecraft in order to modify it with this mod

Donations using the new system activate instantly on your Discord and Minecraft accounts. If you donated through the old system (I'm sorry), it can take up to 72 hours to be processed. If you forgot to include your discord or minecraft accounts in the payment note or message please DM @Brady.

I know there is a 1.15.2 version, but how long until there is just a 1.15 version? Also is there any way in the game files to change the version to 1.15?

[05-Mar-20 04:59 AM] Arisa#5591
There very likely wont be 1.15

[05-Mar-20 04:59 AM] Arisa#5591

Just wondering

[05-Mar-20 05:02 AM] roberto2kk#0210
I paid 5 dollars to use this on our friends 1.15 server and was a little disappointed when I found out there was only 1.15.2. I'm willing to try anything but I'm not so sure if there is a way to get 1.15.

[05-Mar-20 05:03 AM] Arisa#5591
"paid"
you donated and recived gift, and it was stated its for 1.15.2

[05-Mar-20 05:03 AM] Arisa#5591

[05-Mar-20 05:03 AM] Arisa#5591
you cant do anything

[05-Mar-20 05:03 AM] Arisa#5591
your friend should update

[05-Mar-20 05:03 AM] Arisa#5591

[05-Mar-20 05:13 AM] Young Bobby Kennedy#0001

[05-Mar-20 02:31 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
@Setekh something in your internet connection is blocking access to the github

[05-Mar-20 02:54 PM] Setekh#1285
i've solved that by modify hosts ,but i don't think that has something to do with viruses

[05-Mar-20 06:27 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
he also has to make an impact account for you @Lazykiller999

[05-Mar-20 06:27 PM] Lazykiller999#9999
f

[05-Mar-20 06:27 PM] Seven Oaks#5555
best call him on discord for the process or IRL

[05-Mar-20 06:27 PM] Lazykiller999#9999

@xpielordx If that is the case, would you or anyone else happen to know if I am able to disable it through my setting so I don't have to press 'f3 + p' if it were to be enabled again somehow?

[05-Mar-20 07:53 PM] xpielordx#9848
It won't get enabled unless you toggle that again

[05-Mar-20 07:53 PM] xpielordx#9848
You can go easy on the pings btw

[05-Mar-20 07:53 PM] MassaHarambe#5181
Perfect! Thanks again. Also if I need help with setting pathways, then is this the thread to post on?

do you know what could be the issue of the client not starting to run?

[06-Mar-20 12:00 AM] Emito#0750
i tried the noverify thing

[06-Mar-20 12:00 AM] archbtw#6699
the issue is that the client isnt running

[06-Mar-20 12:00 AM] Emito#0750
maybe need a different client?

[06-Mar-20 12:01 AM] 『EmeraldSnorlax』#1857
this could be caused by literally anything

[06-Mar-20 12:01 AM] Emito#0750
like i press play but nothing happens

[06-Mar-20 12:01 AM] archbtw#6699

from your computer not being on to you being on a different timeline where impact doesn't exist, it could be caused by literally anything

Also, how did he install the client?

[06-Mar-20 12:03 AM] SlayerFox#7073
Did he use the installer, did he try dropping the installer into somewhere

[06-Mar-20 12:03 AM] SlayerFox#7073

Impact does not support cracked launchers. You can attempt to use the unstable Forge version, but no further support will be provided.

I've been having an issue and looked online for a while, nothing worked. Hoping I can get a fix here. Minecraft opens, loads for a bit, shows a few frames of loading, then crashes.

Can baritone farm wither skeleton skulls?

[06-Mar-20 11:29 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
It can kill wither skeletons a lot
No guarantee it will pick up everything

[06-Mar-20 11:34 AM] BongEatBong#3591
Use #follow entity wither_skeleton with kill aura on

[06-Mar-20 11:34 AM] BongEatBong#3591
At least I think that's wither skeleton id

[06-Mar-20 11:34 AM] BongEatBong#3591
I might be wrong tho so use google

[06-Mar-20 11:50 AM] bmoment#1655
Okay I’ll try it

[06-Mar-20 01:31 PM] Wabbs#3599

[06-Mar-20 01:58 PM] BongEatBong#3591

[06-Mar-20 02:24 PM] Brawler#5805
Is there anyway to set baritone to mine a spesific amount of blocks?

[06-Mar-20 02:30 PM] tdjj#5939
does it exist a way to make baritone place, fill up a shulker and pick it up when your inventory is filled?

It's not your computer if you don't have permission

[06-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Seven Oaks#5555

Hello, I am having some troubles with the impact installer gui and I am trying to install it via the cli commands but it does not seem to work for me. I am running this command `java -jar ImpactInstaller-0.8.4.jar --no-gui -i 4.6-1.12.2 --mc-dir /home/anton/.minecraft/`  Here is the output I am getting when I run the command https://pastebin.com/H3qiuqwW

[07-Mar-20 01:13 AM] Oona#0170
ok so umm.. is that donor cape visible to only me, or to other donors too? and how do i disable it?

[07-Mar-20 01:14 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
its visible to all impact users

[07-Mar-20 01:14 AM] Seven Oaks#5555
you can disable it clientside
i dont see a reason for hiding it serverside too except for cheating, which is disadvised.
if you desperately need it removed message a dev.

[07-Mar-20 01:15 AM] SlayerFox#7073
And what reason do you have to disable it?

[07-Mar-20 01:15 AM] SlayerFox#7073
The cape is visible whether or not your actively using impact, so it doesn't prove anything.

[07-Mar-20 01:15 AM] Oona#0170
ok but how i disable it clientside ^.^;

[07-Mar-20 01:16 AM] XPHonza#1111
in skin customization is a button called impact cape

[07-Mar-20 01:16 AM] Oona#0170
cosmetic reasons @SlayerFox

[07-Mar-20 01:17 AM] SlayerFox#7073
Oh, in that case, go into settings and disable it under skin settings or wherever.

[07-Mar-20 01:17 AM] SlayerFox#7073
Somewhere in settings is a button to turn off your cape (client-side)
